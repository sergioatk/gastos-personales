## ðŸ’» Initiate web client

You can use this API REST fully with the included web client, just point your browser to the base url.

## ðŸ”— How the API works.

(Providing you are running this on server localhost, port 3000)

These are the endpoints where you can request data from this API REST:

All routes initiate with 'base url/movements/...'

### Get all movements (both income and expenses)

e.g. http://localhost:3000/movements/

Here you'll get an array filled with all the movements logged in the DB, regardless if income / expense.

### Get movement by ID

e.g. http://localhost:3000/movements/id/3

Url structure is /movements/id/(actual id number)

Here you'll get details for movement with id 3 logged in the DB, or an error message if there is not one.

### Get movements by type (income or expense)

e.g. http://localhost:3000/movements/type/expense

Here you'll get an array filled with all movements with type expense.

e.g. http://localhost:3000/movements/type/income

Here you'll get an array filled with all movements with type income.

### Post a new movement

e.g. http://localhost:3000/movements/

Make a post request to the base url, the body must be JSON following the next structure: 

e.g. http://localhost:3000/movements/

e.g. October 12th 2020, gym membership, expense, $80

{
  "date": "2020-10-12",
  "type": "expense",
  "description": "gym memebership",
  "amount": "80"
}

### Edit a movement

Note that changing the type of movement is not possible. Once the movement is created as income or expense, it will remain this way until deleted.

Make a put request to base url/(actual id number), the body must be JSON following the next structure: 

e.g. http://localhost:3000/movements/203

Car payment was 200 but because a typo, the movement was created with ampount $2000.

{
  "date": "2021-02-27",
  "description": "car payment",
  "amount": "200"
}

### Deleting a movement

Make a delete request to base url/(actual id number) to delete the record.
